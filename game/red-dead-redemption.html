		<h1 style="font-family: Rye;font-size: 50px;" class="fontsmall-tablet">Red Dead Redemption II</h1>
		<h1>A meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era.</h1>
		<p class="margin-top justify">Red Dead Redemption 2 is a sprawling Western tale of loyalty, conviction, and the price of infamy, chronicling the inevitable collapse of a motley crew of Wild West holdouts kicking against the slow march of civilisation and industrialisation. Set in Rockstar’s most authentic and lived-in open world ever, there are so many things to do, so many people to meet, and so many places to explore it’s giddily overwhelming. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just Rockstar’s greatest achievement to date; it’s a game so lacking in compromise it’s tough to know where best to start discussing it.</p>
		<p class="margin-top justify">So let’s start at the beginning: It’s 1899 and American outlaws are an endangered species. Dutch van der Linde and his gang are on the run after a botched heist in the growing town of Blackwater and they’ve retreated high into the mountains where an atrocious blizzard is covering their escape. We slip into the spurs of Arthur Morgan, an exceedingly cool and capable outlaw who was found by Dutch as a boy and raised on the wrong side of the law, and settle in for a roughly 60-hour story.</p>
		</div>

		<span class="fontsmall ">Red Dead Redemption 2| &copy;wallpaper Abyss</span>
		<div class="col-10-mar col-m-11-mar col-s-12">
			<p class="margin-top justify">It’s a self-contained and linear introduction but it’s a clever one. The slick cinematics make a hell of first impression, embedding you in the gang and bringing you right up close to the characters who are doing their best to bellow over the howling wind. It also placed me in a distraction-free bubble while I learned some of Red Dead Redemption 2’s early controls and systems, which heightened the impact of having the full map open up to me a few hours later. The conditions on the mountain are almost claustrophobic, with visibility at a premium and thick snow trapping Arthur’s feet. Being set loose in the true open world after toughing it out in this intentionally oppressive environment really underscores the incredible feeling of freedom the full map offers.</p>
			<div class="margin-top"><h1 style="font-size: 30px; color:#AA4A44">The Big Country</h1></div>
			<p class="margin-top justify">And what a world it is; broader, more beautiful, and more varied than the one we explored in 2010’s Red Dead Redemption by a massive margin (though parts of that game’s map are also included). There are snowy peaks and dank, alligator-infested swamps. Thick forests and open plateaus. Quaint homesteads and grand plantations. Narrow streams and great lakes. Dusty gulches and dim caves. There’s the muddy livestock town of Valentine, with its wooden buildings and rustic charm, and then there’s the imposing city of Saint Denis, a grimy and growing metropolis full of modern extravagances like electric trams, paved roads, and Chinese restaurants. The vast assortment of ecosystems and environments seamlessly stitched together here is nothing short of remarkable.</p>

		<div class="col-10-mar col-m-11-mar col-s-12">
		<p class="margin-top justify">Red Dead Redemption 2 does an exceptional job at slowly rationing out reasons to visit every corner of its huge world, too. I was still led to areas of the map I hadn’t yet visited even in the closing stages of its 60-hour main storyline. Because so many cards are kept up its sleeve, the joy of discovering new parts of the world is maintained throughout.</p>
		<div class="margin-top"><h1 style="font-size: 30px; color:#AA4A44; line-height: 30px;">The ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is extraodinary</h1></div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">The ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is extraordinary, and not entirely due to just the size and diversity of the world; it’s how alive all of those places feel. While the largely rural world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is far less dense than the likes of Grand Theft Auto V, it’s absolutely brimming with wildlife to discover, people to interact with (and potentially help), and places to scrutinise. The best kind of open worlds are those that seem almost indifferent to your presence in them; like life goes on whether you stick your nose into proceedings or not. I’ve sat and watched lumberjacks felling trees at a bustling logging camp and curiously tailed a perturbed Englishman wandering around town looking for his mate “Gav.” None of this is crucial to the progression of Arthur’s story; it just helps build a world around him that made me feel like a visitor rather than the centre of the universe. Red Dead Redemption 2 nails this in a way that few – if any – games have before.</div>
		<div class="margin-top"><h1 style="font-size: 30px; color:#AA4A44; line-height: 30px;">In a Valley of Violence</h1></div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">The slower pace of Red Dead Redemption 2 compared to something like the slightly more breakneck GTA V is also a big part of how it encouraged me to drink in all the world has to offer. Bodies have to be manually looted, and Arthur needs to physically manhandle a body to do so. Single-action pistols need to be cocked before firing. Guns Arthur isn’t currently carrying need to retrieved from his saddle. Coffee needs to be brewed before drinking it</div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">I suspect some folk may regard this sort of stuff as chore-like, but I really dig it. There’s something methodical about it that really helps ground Arthur in the world, rather than have him feel like he’s gliding through it. For instance, I love the deliberate and mechanical process of cycling a new cartridge with a lever-action rifle via a second pull of the fire button – you can even pause for dramatic effect halfway through. Rockstar’s designers didn’t need to factor that in but I think they understand that tiny, almost trivial instances of subtle control like this subconsciously seat me into the world as Arthur even more</div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">The unhurried pace of checking vanquished enemies for goodies is an interesting design decision but I quite like the risk versus reward loot loop, to be honest. Do I dart around and pickpocket a dozen dead guys or do I just get the hell out of Dodge? They’re consequences you have to be prepared to accept either because your attention is needed elsewhere or because lingering around the scene of a crime naturally puts you at further risk of being discovered. Bounties don’t always come cheap. Did one of those fellas have a gold nugget in his trousers? Perhaps you’ll never know.</div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">About my only major logistical gripe is that the weapons I was previously carrying are regularly swapped out for others. Oftentimes it’s clearly mission-related to ensure you go into a task with a scoped rifle or bow when required, which is fine. More irksome are the times I end up with mismatching pistols for dual wielding, with the game trading out my preference. The admittedly brief bit of time it takes to swap back did elicit the occasional grumble from me.</div></div>

		<div class="margin-top"><h1 style="font-size: 30px; color:#AA4A44; line-height: 30px;">I spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a virtual museum</h1></div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">At any rate, it’s seriously worth settling into the pace Rockstar is trying to set here because there’s just so much to see and hear. You’ll hear unique, one-time conversations that occur in camp after certain missions, as well as other bespoke bits of dialogue that reference recent events. Strolling through camp, I’ve been privy to everything from a heated bust-up between John Marston and his partner, Abigail, to the good-natured con man Hosea Matthews regaling the young Jack Marston with stories of his latest fishing adventure. This is all happening around Arthur whether you pause to eavesdrop or not. It makes the camp feel like a concentrated version of the world at large, a place with people going about their business and interacting with one another completely independently of you. I can’t understate the genuine feeling of life this injects into the overall experience for me.</div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">Elsewhere in the world there’s still plenty for those who care to stop and smell the roses. Newspapers sold on street corners touch on the aftermath of Arthur’s exploits, as well as other things going on around the world. Much like in GTA V, you can visit theatres and take in some old timey entertainment. Dogs can be patted. I spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a virtual museum. There’s simply too much to list.</div>
		<div class="margin-top"><h1 style="font-size: 30px; color:#AA4A44; line-height: 30px;">How the Ewst Was Won</h1></div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">The main story missions themselves are a cocktail of high-stakes heists, deadly shootouts, desperate rescues, and thrilling chases, mixed with a lengthy list of other activities. Many of those function as organic ways to teach us about new side hustles and activities that can be undertaken, from selling stolen horses to playing poker or fishing.</div></div>
		<img class="img margin-top" src="rdr5.jpg">
		<span class="fontsmall ">RDR2 gameplay| &copy;wallpaperflare </span>
		<div class="col-10-mar col-m-11-mar col-s-12">
		<div class="margin-top justify">It all feels great to play, similar in a lot of ways to its immediate predecessor but injected with a pile of new animations and multiple layers of interactivity. It asks a lot of the finite amount of buttons on a controller, but once I became accustomed to which commands require a tap and which require a press-and-hold I had few hassles. Shootouts are supremely cinematic thanks to plenty of gun smoke and the same style of on-the-fly, ever-changing death animations that have characterised Rockstar games since GTA IV. You can even shoot off people’s hats and pick them up later for yourself.</div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">I think there’s a common presumption that Red Dead Redemption is just GTA on a horse, but that’s a bit reductive. Certainly the GTA DNA is here, but with far more primitive firearms at your fingertips gun battles are more intimate and anarchic. I love the close range clashes, hunkered down behind bits of cover exchanging lead with enemies often just yards away, or slugging it out in bareknuckle scraps. It’s exciting and fun. Combat from horseback is equally well-handled and it’s always a grisly highlight to watch unfortunate saps go limp and tumble from the saddle in a seemingly endless number of ways. I think Arthur feels a fraction heavier than any of the GTA V trio, but I would not say that I found his movement cumbersome. I really like how connected Arthur feels to the world. I’m not a particular fan of that old-school, skating third-person feel – like the player character has no inertia – and that’s certainly not present here.</div>
		<div class="margin-top justify">Dead Eye returns, naturally, as it’s been part of the series since Red Dead Revolver. It’s had some upgrades this time, the most useful of which highlights critical hit areas on a target (very useful for clean kills while hunting). It’s still a very effective way to make you feel like an unstoppable gunslinger and the gruesome ballet of slow-motion death-dealing remains disturbingly satisfying.</div></div>
		
		<div class="col-10-mar col-m-11-mar col-s-12">
		<div class="margin-top justify">
		I didn’t engage much with the available camp upgrade options – not the aesthetic ones, at least. There are some practical upgrades I acquired that had gameplay benefits attached, like a boat to go fishing in or a map at Arthur’s quarters that unlocks fast travel. I don’t feel like I missed much by opting out of purchasing animal skulls and rugs and such. This stuff feels a little more like a primer for Red Dead Online, the multiplayer component coming at an unspecified later date.</div>
		<div class="margin-top justify"><h1>Verdict</h1>
		Red Dead Redemption 2 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of the greatest games of the modern age. It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can’t wait to go back and play more. This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era. Looking for one of this generation’s very best single-player action experiences? Here’s your huckleberry.</div></div>
