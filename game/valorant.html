		<h1 style="font-family: Koulen;font-size: 50px;">Valorant</h1>
		<h1 style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 30px; color: #8b0000;">Clever tactical shooting that's plenty deep, and a lot of fun to master.</h1>
		<p class="margin-top justify">Riot Games has stayed in its lane for a long time. Keeping to itself, building League of Legends with a dabble in Teamfight Tactics, the nonetheless vast and wealthy studio rarely bothered itself with the outside world – that was until last year.</p>
		<p class="margin-top justify">Riot dipped a toe in the world of CCGs with Legends of Runeterra and announced a planned cannonball into the pool of competitive FPS with Project A – a code name for the game we now know as Valorant. Valorant is best described through games that existed before it. By mixing the competitive formula of Counter-Strike with the characters of Overwatch, Valorant is cribbing from two of the most successful games in this space. There was little doubt in my mind that the game was going to be at least good – and perhaps great.</p>
		<p class="margin-top justify">Valorant is an FPS hero shooter, and like many top tier triple-A games these days, each hero you play commands different abilities, displays different personalities, and boasts a distinct visual style – in other words, they’re true characters. Each ‘agent’ has the same choice of guns as any other – an important distinction from Overwatch – but with extra smokes, grenades, or other tactical equipment that are unique to them.</p>
		</div>
		<img class="img" src="valorant1.jpg">
		<span class="fontsmall margin-left">Valorant game play| &copy;mocahwallpaper </span>
		<div class="col-10-mar col-m-11-mar col-s-12">
			<p class="margin-top justify">These abilities are far more straightforward to learn than in Overwatch. Omen, Jett, Brimstone, Cypher, and Viper all have some form of smokes, for example orbs of wisps (or a circle of static for Cypher). Their colours, methods of distribution, and secondary effects may differ a little, but their primary function is the same: blocking enemy vision so that you can move more freely, perhaps setting up a flank or establishing control over an area. Other shared abilities include Phoenix and Viper being able to deploy smoke in a line, while Phoenix, Brimstone, and Viper all command similar abilities to spread damage over an area, like CS:GO’s molotovs. There are some truly unique abilities to each agent – ultimates being the best example – but it’ll take you a lot less time to get a feel for the general playing field in Valorant than in Rainbow Six: Siege, Overwatch, or even Amazon’s new contender, Crucible.</p>
			<p class="margin-top justify">That said, it’s obvious that these agents owe Overwatch a large debt in their design. Riot really isn’t shy about admitting it when there’s a mechanic it likes: Hanzo’s sonar arrow, Mei’s ice wall, and edgy edge-lords with teleportation abilities like Reaper all find close equivalents in Valorant’s roster. I said as much in my Valorant gameplay preview, and it’s worth reiterating. I wouldn’t go as far as to say it’s a one-to-one rip-off, but very much ‘Can I copy your homework? I promise I’ll change it enough that the teacher won’t know.’ This might explain why, in Overwatch, I know and love the heroes I’m playing, while no such attachment has yet manifested itself in Valorant (although the new selection screen animations give them more personality than they had in the beta).</p>

		<span class="fontsmall ">Valorant| &copy;seagame </span>
		<div class="col-10-mar col-m-11-mar col-s-12">
			<p class="margin-top justify">Riot’s other inspiration was, of course, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I admit I never got much into CS:GO – my FPS experience comes from elsewhere, and although at first I found Valorant’s pacing and mechanics frustrating, forgetting to check corners etc, I quickly grew to enjoy them. Valorant has a steep learning curve, but it’s also a short one – after the first few steps, all becomes clear. If you are familiar with CS:GO, I have it on good word that Valorant is a nice expansion on mechanics you already know. Character abilities, in particular, differentiate Valorant enough that you can enjoy it and CS:GO as separate entities.</p>
		<p class="margin-top">Valorant has four maps currently in play, and with each, the developers explained to me that they’re aiming to ask a question or offer a unique element. For Split that’s the vertical ropes, for Haven it’s an extra bomb site, for Bind it’s teleporters, and for Ascent it’s windows and doors. These elements do change the field of play enough to deliver a fresh experience with each map, and Riot gets a pat on the back for this success.</p>

		<span class="fontsmall ">Valorant| &copy;apkpure</span>
	<div class="col-10-mar col-m-11-mar col-s-12">
		<p class="margin-top justify">Riot gets a second pat on the back for the two modes in the full game. The beta contained only the standard CS:GO-inspired mode in which teams battle to place or defuse a ‘spike’ (a bomb) or eliminate the other team, with the first team to 13 wins taking the match. That’s quite a commitment – I’d say on average, matches last around 40 minutes. For the full release, however, Riot has added Spike Rush: everyone on the attacking team has a spike, everyone has the same gun and all their abilities (except their ultimate), and the map is adorned with orbs granting advantages like a better gun, a damage multiplier, and more. It’s quick, fun, and a great way to either warm up for the main event or simply to experience Valorant without stressing out.</p>
		<p class="margin-top"><h1 style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 30px; color: #8b0000;">The Verdict</h1></p>
		<p class="margin-top justify">Valorant is the most fun I've had with a multiplayer FPS since Valve's Team Fortress 2. The flexibility of its magically-infused cast paired with a deep arsenal makes for a magnificent competitive canvas, if a tricky one to initially pick up. I'm already pondering new strategies to pull off with my friends in the future, and that joyous daydreaming won't stop anytime soon. It may not be the prettiest modern FPS around, but its visual simplicity enables excellent clarity in every fight. With its teeth sunk in this deep, Valorant makes me want to keep playing until there's nothing left to master. </p>
